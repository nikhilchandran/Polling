For HTTP, data is returned to the client either by use of a callback function , which will automatically convert the data to a JSON format ,ie: 'callback( [object data] )` or by piping data directly back into the response object.\n\nSupported HTTP verbs ( as of 0.2.1 ):\n\n* GET\n\n* HEAD\n\n* PUT\n\n* POST\n\n* DELETE\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation \n\n    npm install narf\n\nIf you want command line functionality then the following is suggested:\n\n\tsudo npm install -g narf\n\t\n#### Versoning\n\nIf you are looking for an earlier version of narf for any reason ,simply specify the version in npm: \n\n\tnpm install narf@x.x.x\n\n### Functions\n\n* pageServer()\n\n* configure()\t\t\t\t-\tdepricated\n\n* narfSocketServer()\t\t-\tdepricated\n\n* getConnectedClients()\t\t- \tdepricated\n\n* setDebug()\n\t\n### Classes\n\n#### HttpServer\n\n* ##### Functions:  \n\n    * start()\n\n    * addAPI()\n\n    * addWebSocket( )\n\n* ##### Events:\n\n    * port \n\n    * error\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found in Docs.md or [here](http://divanvisagie.github.com/NARF/)\n## Examples\n\nExamples of narf implementation can be found in examples/ or on the narf [wiki](https://github.com/divanvisagie/NARF/wiki/Usage-Examples)\n\n## Compatibility\n\nNARF is  tested under OSX and can run on Windows as well but should run smoothly on other platforms\n\n## Configurable Functionality\n\n### HTTPS\n\nHTTPS is switched off by default in the config due to its requirements, if you wish to switch it on you will need to provide the relative paths to your key and certificate files.\n\nIf you want to create your own files for testing you can run generate_cert.sh( only tested on OSX ), but these certificates will be viewed as untrusted.\n\nto generate a generate_cert.sh file run the following command:\n\n\tnarf generate\nor:\n\n    narf -g\n\n## Testing\n\nUnit tests for narf are located in the tests directory , to run:\n\n\tnode ./tests/test.js \n\nor:\n\n\tnpm test narf\n\nLegacy\n======\n\nNarf has some legacy functions , they work perfectly but are depricated because their designs were not futureproof. These depricated functions are still functional and their docuentation can be found [here](https://github.com/divanvisagie/NARF/wiki/Legacy)\n\n## License \n\n### MIT License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 Divan Visagie\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
